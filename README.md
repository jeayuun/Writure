## ‚úÖ Accomplished Project Goals

This project was built to master fundamental and advanced web development concepts. Here is a summary of the goals set for this project and how they were achieved:

* **Understand MVC, Routing, and CRUD Operations**: The application is built on the Laravel 11 framework, strictly following the Model-View-Controller (MVC) structure. It features basic and advanced routing and full Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) functionality for posts, categories, tags, and users.
* **Build a Blog System with Authentication**: The core of the project is a functional blog where authenticated users can manage content. Authentication is handled by Laravel Breeze, providing secure registration, login, and password management.
* **Implement Advanced Backend Skills**: The project includes more advanced Laravel features such as middleware to protect admin routes, custom policies for authorization, and complex database relationships to handle multilingual content efficiently.
* **Responsive UI with Headless Components (Radix UI Principles)**: The UI is fully responsive, built with Tailwind CSS. A primary goal was to "Extend CRUD project with Radix UI components." While direct installation of Radix-related libraries was blocked by local environment issues, the core philosophy was successfully implemented. The project features custom-built, unstyled, and fully accessible components for modals, dropdowns, and tabs using Alpine.js, achieving the same headless UI objective.
* **Dynamic User Roles and Permissions**: The system implements a clear distinction between regular users and administrators. An `is_admin` flag on the users model, combined with an `IsAdmin` middleware, protects all backend routes and ensures only authorized users can perform administrative actions.
